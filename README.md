# pgtd-replayer


Replayer/Auto-strat for Pixel Gun Tower Defense

Record Strat:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usamiername/pgtd-replayer/main/minified-rec.lua"))()
```

Strat will then be saved to the workspace folder of your executor. (./recorded-pgtd.lua). Can be executed from then on, no changes needed, or placed in the autoexec folder.

Not adjusted for lag - efficacy of the script depends on your lag /!\\

Somewhat autoexec friendly - can crash but there are SOME countermeasures against it.

Did not test for bugs. If you find one, let me know.
